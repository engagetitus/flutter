# Framework Layer 🏗️
- The topmost layer of Flutter, written in Dart, provides widgets, rendering, animation, and gestures.

# Engine Layer 🔧
- This layer, written in C++, provides low-level rendering support using Skia, handles text layout, and more.

# Embedder Layer 🌐
- The platform-specific layer that hosts the Flutter engine. It is responsible for rendering a Flutter app within a native application on each platform.
