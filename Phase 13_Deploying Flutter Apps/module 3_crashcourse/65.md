# 65_Ensuring Data Security and Integrity

**Objective:** Ensure the security and integrity of data in the application.

#### Key Points

- **Data Security**: Protect data from unauthorized access.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate and consistent.

#### Steps

1. **Set Up Firestore Security Rules**:
   - Example Firestore security rules:

     ```firestore
     rules_version = '2';
     service cloud.firestore {
       match /databases/{database}/documents {
         match /students/{studentId} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
         }
         match /teachers/{teacherId} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Validate Data on the Backend**:
   - Ensure data validation in your backend functions.

3. **Use Secure Authentication Methods**:
   - Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords are securely handled and never stored in plaintext.
