# Session 5: Best Practices for Using sqflite 

## Data Size
- **Small to Medium Data:** Use sqflite for small to medium datasets.
- **Large Data:** For larger datasets, consider using a more robust database solution.

## Database Schema
- **Schema Design:** Design the database schema carefully to avoid future migrations.
- **Normalization:** Normalize data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Performance
- **Indexing:** Create indexes for frequently queried columns to improve performance.
- **Batch Operations:** Use batch operations to perform multiple queries efficiently.

## Security
- **Encryption:** Use encryption to secure sensitive data.
- **Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

## Error Handling
- **Try-Catch:** Use try-catch blocks to handle database errors gracefully.
- **Logging:** Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for database operations.
- **Mock Databases:** Use mock databases for testing purposes.
