Flutter
is Google’s Mobile SDK (Software Development Kit) to build native iOS and Android, Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS), and Web apps from a single codebase. 

 The key advantage of Flutter is its ability to provide a native experience on both iOS and Android platforms with a single codebase. This is achieved through a rich set of fully-customizable widgets to build native interfaces in minutes.   

Here are some of the popular apps developed by Google using Flutter:

Google Ads is an advertising management app used by advertisers and digital marketers. It provides a seamless experience in managing campaigns and ads.
Google’s own payment app uses Flutter, providing a seamless user experience across all devices.

These apps demonstrate how Google itself is leveraging Flutter’s capabilities for its own products, showcasing the trust and confidence Google has in Flutter’s potential for creating high-quality applications. It’s worth noting that over a thousand engineers at Google are building apps with Dart and Flutter3, further emphasizing the importance of Flutter within Google’s own ecosystem.
