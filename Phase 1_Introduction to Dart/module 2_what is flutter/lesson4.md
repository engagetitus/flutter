Pros
Flutter uses a single codebase, called, Dart for both platforms, Android and iOS which is a simple language ensuring type safety.
Both Flutter language and community are developing with great speed, releasing new features, widgets, and add-ons.
Flutter has its own set of widgets rather than using the widgets provided by the host operating system which means the user provides its own gesture recognition model, thus, having greater control over the precise rendering or customization of the widgets.
The hot-reloading is a game-changer in the productivity of the development process. It gives a lively effect to the app under development, thus making the whole development cycle more exciting for the UI/UX developer using Flutter.
Flutter is not bound to the ROM w.r.t. the widget system. So, it enhances its portability over a wide ambit of Android versions and thus, lowering its dependencies on the host platform.
Dart and Flutter unite closely to optimize dart Virtual Machine(VM) for those mobiles which are specifically needed by Flutter.
Flutter is an established player in the field of cross-platform application development with amazing community support.
CONS
In reality, there are no cons to flutter because there isn’t any other framework as effective and elaborate as flutter. Even though if we have to list any it would be related to Dart programming language as while converting dart to JavaScript there are some bugs to be fixed, dart doesn’t have a framework for backend, etc.,

App performance is higher. Flutter 60 fps or 120 fps animation. Flutter itself paints and controls every single pixel on the screen
High. It requires the JavaScript bridge to interact with the native components.
Flutter is the fastest growing framework for cross-platform development. Community support for flutter is amazing, with over 11100 Github stars, 15000 forks and over 41000 closed issues, it is leading the industry.
Community support for React Native is also good but it is not growing as fast as flutter. It has over 9300 Github stars, 20000 forks and over 19700 closed issues.
