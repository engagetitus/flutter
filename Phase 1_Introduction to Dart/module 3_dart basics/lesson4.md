1 . Create a Dart Program to calculate area of a circle: Formula: PI multiplied by radius squared(PI R squared)

2. (Payroll) Write a program that stores the following values in variables and prints the Gross pay & Net pay
Variable should hold:
Employees Full Name (e.g. Jean Zakwani)
Numbers of Hours worked in a week (e.g. 40 )
Hourly Pay Rate (e.g. 6.75)
Federal Tax withholding rate (e.g. 0.2)
State Tax withholding rate (e.g. 0.09)

You should calculate:
Gross Pay = hourly pay rate * numbers of hours worked in a week.
Federal Tax withholding = Federal Tax withholding rate * gross pay
State Tax withholding = State Tax withholding rate * gross pay
Total Deductions = Federal Tax withholding + State Tax withholding
Net Pay = Gross Pay - Total Deductions

Output should be something like;
Gross Pay: $ 270
Net Pay: $191.7
