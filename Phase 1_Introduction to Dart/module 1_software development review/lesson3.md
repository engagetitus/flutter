Dart is a client-optimized programming language for fast apps on any platform. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.

## Dart Syntax and Features 📝

- **Variables**: Used to store data.

  ```dart
  // Declaring a variable
  int age = 25;  // Integer variable
  String name = 'John';  // String variable

  ```

- **Functions**: Used to encapsulate code that performs a specific task.

``` dart

// Function to add two numbers
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;  // Returning the sum of a and b
}
Control Flow: Using if-else statements.``` dart

// Checking if a number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int num) {
  if (num % 2 == 0) {
    print('$num is even');  // Printing if the number is even
  } else {
    print('$num is odd');  // Printing if the number is odd
  }
}
