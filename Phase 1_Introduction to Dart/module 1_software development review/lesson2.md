# Lesson 2: Development Tools and Environments

## Overview

Introduction to various tools and environments used in software development.

### Key Concepts

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 🛠️
- Version Control Systems (VCS) 📁
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) 🚀

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 🛠️

An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. Examples include:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight but powerful source code editor.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: An IDE for Java development, also supports other languages.

## Version Control Systems (VCS) 📁

VCS are systems that help you track changes to your code over time. Examples include:

- **Git**: A distributed version control system.
- **GitHub**: A web-based interface that uses Git.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) 🚀

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. Examples include:

- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows for your GitHub repositories.
