## What is Software Development? ðŸ’»

Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ðŸ”„

The SDLC is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The phases include:

1. **Planning**: Define the scope and purpose of the project.
2. **Analysis**: Gather detailed business requirements.
3. **Design**: Create the system architecture.
4. **Implementation**: Write the code.
5. **Testing**: Verify that the software works as intended.
6. **Deployment**: Release the software to users.
7. **Maintenance**: Perform ongoing support and maintenance.

### Agile vs. Waterfall methodologies ðŸš€

- **Waterfall**: Sequential design process, often used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through phases.
- **Agile**: Iterative and incremental approach to software development, promoting flexible responses to change.
