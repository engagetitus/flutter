# Module 1: Software Architecture vs Design Pattern

## Lesson 1: Understanding Software Architecture

### What is Software Architecture?
Software Architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures. It involves:
- Defining software elements
- Relationships among elements
- Properties of elements and relationships

### Common Architectural Patterns
- **Monolithic Architecture**
- **Microservices Architecture**
- **Layered Architecture**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

### Example: Layered Architecture
