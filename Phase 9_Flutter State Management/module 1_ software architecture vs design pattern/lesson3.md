# Lesson 3: Comparing Architecture and Design Patterns

## Differences Between Software Architecture and Design Patterns

- **Scope**: Architecture deals with the structure and organization of high-level components; design patterns deal with the implementation of smaller-scale solutions.
- **Abstraction**: Architecture provides a broader abstraction compared to design patterns.
- **Impact**: Architecture impacts the entire system; design patterns impact specific parts of the system.

### When to Use Each

- **Architecture**: When designing the overall structure of the application.
- **Design Patterns**: When solving specific problems within the defined architecture.

### Example: Combining Both

```plaintext
+---------------------------+
|         Architecture      |
+---------------------------+
|  Design Patterns Layer    |
+---------------------------+
| Specific Implementation   |
