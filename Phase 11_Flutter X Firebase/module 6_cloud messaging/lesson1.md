## Lesson 1: Introduction to Cloud Messaging

### Overview of Cloud Messaging

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably deliver messages at no cost.

FCM enables you to send notifications directly to users' devices, which is crucial for engaging users with timely content. It supports both notification messages (which are handled by the system tray) and data messages (handled by the app in the foreground).

### Use Cases for Cloud Messaging

- **User Engagement**: Re-engage users with customized content updates, offers, and reminders.
- **Real-time Updates**: Notify users about real-time events like live sports scores or chat messages.
- **System Alerts**: Inform users about system events, like maintenance schedules or availability issues.
- **Push Notifications**: Send targeted messages to users based on their interests, location, or behavior.
