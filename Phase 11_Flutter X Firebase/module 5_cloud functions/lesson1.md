# Module 6: Cloud Functions

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Cloud Functions
Cloud Functions is a serverless computing service provided by Firebase. It allows developers to write and deploy code that runs in a managed environment, which scales automatically with your app's needs.

### Overview of Cloud Functions

Cloud Functions lets you run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features (like changes in Firestore, user actions in Firebase Authentication, or incoming HTTP requests) without managing your own servers.

Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests.

## Key Features

- **Serverless**: Automatically manages and scales the underlying infrastructure.
- **Event-driven**: Executes code in response to Firebase events or HTTP requests.
- **Integrated**: Seamlessly integrates with other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services.

- **Scalable**: Automatically scales to handle changes in traffic or load.

### Use Cases for Cloud Functions

- **Automated tasks**: Perform actions like sending notifications or processing transactions automatically in response to user actions or other events.
- **Data handling**: Manipulate or validate data before storing it in a database.
- **APIs and webhooks**: Create APIs that are triggered by HTTP requests.


- Data validation
- Sending notifications
- Performing automated tasks

## Summary
The flexibility and integration capabilities of Cloud Functions make it a powerful tool for extending the functionality of web and mobile applications without adding complexity to client-side code.
